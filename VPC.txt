CIDR  - Subnet mask

subnet mask basically allows part of the underlying IP to get the additional next values from the base IP

192.168.0.0/32 -> it meanes it will have only one IP address i.e 192.168.0.0
because -- 32 - 32 = 0 , and 2 to the power 0 is 1

like that 192.168.0.0/31 -> it means it will have only 2 IP addresses i.e 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.1
because -- 32 - 31 = 1, and 2 to the power 1 is 2 

192.168.0.0/0 => it means it will accessbile to the whole internet

--PUBLIC/PRIVATE IPV4
-internet assigned numbers authority established certain blocks of IPV4 addresses for use of privae LAN and public addresses

private IP can only allow certain values 
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 -> in big networkd

and all the rest can be accessed and are public

-you can have multiple VLCs in an AWS region (max 5 per region)
-max CIDR per VPC is 5 but  you can exceed it
-min size is /28 ( 16 ip addresses)
-max size is /16 (65536 ip addresses)

-your vpc cidr should now collide with other network
