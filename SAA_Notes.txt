CloudWatch provides metrics for every service in AWS.
A metric is a variable you want to monitor.
Metrics belong to namespaces.
A dimension is an attribute of a metric.
You can have up to 30 dimensions per metric.
You can create CloudWatch dashboards to visualize metrics.
You can also create CloudWatch custom metrics.

CloudWatch Metric Streams:
Metric Streams continuously stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice with near real-time delivery and low latency.
Metric Streams send data in near real time to Kinesis Data Firehose, which can deliver the metrics to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon OpenSearch for monitoring and analysis.
After the data lands in S3, you can query it with Athena.


AWS Databases - 
RDBMS (SQL/OLTP) -> RDS, aurora great for joins
NoSQL - no joins no sqlm dynamoDB, elasticache(key value, documentDB for mongoDB, keyspaces
Object store S3 - for big objects/glacier (for backups)


VPC - 
CIDR - classless inter domain routing - method for allocating IP addresses\
it depends on the subnet masks how many devices will be there

-we've seen xx.xx.xxx.tt/32 => one ip
-we;ve seen 0.0.0.0/0 => one IP
-but we can define 192.168.0.0/26 => 192.168.0.0 - 192.168/0.63 => 63 ip addresses
