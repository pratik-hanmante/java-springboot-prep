Amazon EFS – Shared File System for Multiple EC2s
Amazon EFS is like a shared drive that multiple EC2 instances can mount at the same time using NFSv4. It’s fully managed and elastic, growing or shrinking as needed. Unlike EBS (which can attach to only one instance), EFS works across multiple Availability Zones and is great for web apps, microservices, shared logs, or CMS storage. If you move data from EBS to EFS, all EC2s can access the same files instantly without manual syncing.

Secure S3 Access from Private EC2 – Use VPC Gateway Endpoint
If EC2 instances are in a private subnet with no internet or NAT Gateway, create a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3. This keeps all traffic inside AWS’s internal network, improving security and reducing latency and cost. Combine with IAM and bucket policies to allow access only through that endpoint.

Secure Static Website on S3 – Use CloudFront + ACM
S3 by itself doesn’t support HTTPS. To serve a secure website, use CloudFront in front of the S3 bucket and issue a free SSL/TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). CloudFront gives you HTTPS, caching, global delivery, and DDoS protection. The setup is: user → CloudFront → S3.

Restrict Access to Only Organization Accounts
If you are using AWS Organizations and want only your org’s accounts to access your S3 bucket or other services, add the condition key aws:PrincipalOrgID to your IAM or bucket policy. This automatically includes all accounts in the org, no need to manually list them.

Analyze JSON Logs in S3 – Use Amazon Athena
If your logs are stored in S3 and you just need to run SQL queries without setting up servers or databases, Athena is perfect. It’s serverless, queries data directly in S3, and you only pay per query. Works with AWS Glue Data Catalog for schema management and is great for quick analytics or auditing.

Migrate Large On-Prem Data to S3 – Use AWS Snowball Edge
If you have large files (for example, 70 TB of video data, 1 MB–500 GB each) and limited bandwidth, use AWS Snowball Edge. AWS ships you an encrypted 80 TB device; you copy your data locally using the Snowball client or NFS, then send it back. AWS imports the data into S3. It’s offline, fast, secure (256-bit encryption), trackable, and much cheaper than uploading over the internet.

Scale Message Processing – Use SNS + SQS Fan-Out Pattern
When one app produces messages and many microservices need to consume them, the best design is to publish messages to an SNS topic and subscribe multiple SQS queues. Each service reads from its own queue, so they’re fully decoupled and can scale independently. This setup handles spikes (even 100k msgs/sec), guarantees delivery, supports retries and dead-letter queues, and lets you add new consumers easily. Flow: App → SNS Topic → multiple SQS queues → different microservices.

ig we have video file on premis data network attached storage, each video file ranges from 1 mb to 500gb , total storage is 70 tb and is no longer growing so to migrate data using least possible bandwidth 
-we must create a snowball edge job , receive snowball edge device on premise , use the snowball edge client to transfer data to the device and return the device so AWS can import data to s3

company has an app that ingests incoming messages , dozens of other applications and ms then  only consue thes emssages, the number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases 100,000 each second , company wants to decuple and increse scalability
   exp -- 
when it comes to ms and decoupling only two services are relevant 
SQS - > simple queue services -> present the data in the form of queue
SNS -> simple notificaiton service -> just gets and publishes tha data

so if you see either of these services in option its correcct

Ans - publish the messages to an amazon sns topic with multiple amazon sim;le queue services subscriptions consumer the applicaitons to process the message sfrom the queues
        messages -> topic ->SQS -> ms-1
                          ->SQS -> ms-2
                          ->SQS -> ms-3

company migrating distributes applocation to AWS, the spp servers variable workloads, legacy platform consistes of aprimary server that cordinates jobs across multiple comute nodes, company wants to modernize the app with solutuin that maximizes resliency and scalability

so for that answer will need to configure amazon sqs as a destination for the jobs to omplement the compute oned with ec2 that are managed in an autoscaling group

company is running SMB file server in data center , file server costs that are accesed frquently for first few dats afte rfie sar created after 7 days the files are accessed

total data size is increasing and is close to company total storage capaity , saa must increase company available space without loosing low latency access to recently accessed files , saa should provide lifecyle managment to avoid future storage losses

--if there are lifecyel and policies are mentioned and data needs synchrising so option ashould have file gateway
so optin would be with file gateway and lifecycle policy

--Ans create and aws s3 file gatewat to extend the company stporage space, create lifecyle policy to transitin data to s3 glacier deep archive after 7 days

company is building an ecom web app , app sends info about new orders to an amazon api gateway rest api to process the company wants to ensure the orders are processed in the order that reveed order
which solution will meet the requirements

--- so whenver order in order of as they received is there there should be SQS FIFO

so answer is use an api gateay to send message to SQS FIFO queue when app receives and order
configure SQS fifo queue to invoke aws lambda function for processing

company has an application that runs on AWS ec2 instance and uses aws aurora database, the ec2 instances connect to databases by using user names and passwords that are locally stored in a file, company wants to minimize operational overhead of credential management

-- whenver we are mentioned to store the usrnames and passwords we should always look for the option with 
AWS Secrets manager in it 

---Ans
use aws secrets manager , turn on automatic rotation



12 -- 

global company wants to hosts its web apps on EC2 behind the application load balancer , the web application has static data and dynamoc data the company stres its static data in s3 bucket the company want to impove performace and reduce latency of static and dynamic data, company is using its won domain name registered with amazon route 53

13 -- 

company performs monthly maintainance on it AWS infra , during these maintenence activites the company needs to rotate the creds for its amazon RDS for MYsql DB across multiple AWS regions
so to get the leasar operational overhead

--so whenever the db and the creds are mentioned we should go with the aws secret manager

14 --

company runs an ecommernec app on ec2 isntance behind an Application Load balancer , instancces run in an amazon ec2 auto scaling group across multiple availability zones,auto scaling group scales basdd on CPU utilization metrics the ecoomerce the ecom applicatiom stores data in mysql db , that hosted on large ec2
db performace degrades quickly as app load increases , application handles more read request than write actions, company wants a solution that will automatically scale the db to meet demand of unpredictable read workloads

--so  read replcias and because of that amazon aurora with multi az deployment and configure aurora with auto scaling with aurora replicas

15-- 

company migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out the prod VPC , company had an insepction serever in its premises data center , inspeciton server performed specific operations usch as traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering , company wants to have same functionalities in the AWS cloud

-- so whenever the traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering is mentioned the option would be
use AWS network firewall to create the required rules for traffic rules for traffic filtering for prod VPC
