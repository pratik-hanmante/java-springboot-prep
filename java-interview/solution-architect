Amazon EFS – Shared File System for Multiple EC2s
Amazon EFS is like a shared drive that multiple EC2 instances can mount at the same time using NFSv4. It’s fully managed and elastic, growing or shrinking as needed. Unlike EBS (which can attach to only one instance), EFS works across multiple Availability Zones and is great for web apps, microservices, shared logs, or CMS storage. If you move data from EBS to EFS, all EC2s can access the same files instantly without manual syncing.

Secure S3 Access from Private EC2 – Use VPC Gateway Endpoint
If EC2 instances are in a private subnet with no internet or NAT Gateway, create a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3. This keeps all traffic inside AWS’s internal network, improving security and reducing latency and cost. Combine with IAM and bucket policies to allow access only through that endpoint.

Secure Static Website on S3 – Use CloudFront + ACM
S3 by itself doesn’t support HTTPS. To serve a secure website, use CloudFront in front of the S3 bucket and issue a free SSL/TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). CloudFront gives you HTTPS, caching, global delivery, and DDoS protection. The setup is: user → CloudFront → S3.

Restrict Access to Only Organization Accounts
If you are using AWS Organizations and want only your org’s accounts to access your S3 bucket or other services, add the condition key aws:PrincipalOrgID to your IAM or bucket policy. This automatically includes all accounts in the org, no need to manually list them.

Analyze JSON Logs in S3 – Use Amazon Athena
If your logs are stored in S3 and you just need to run SQL queries without setting up servers or databases, Athena is perfect. It’s serverless, queries data directly in S3, and you only pay per query. Works with AWS Glue Data Catalog for schema management and is great for quick analytics or auditing.

Migrate Large On-Prem Data to S3 – Use AWS Snowball Edge
If you have large files (for example, 70 TB of video data, 1 MB–500 GB each) and limited bandwidth, use AWS Snowball Edge. AWS ships you an encrypted 80 TB device; you copy your data locally using the Snowball client or NFS, then send it back. AWS imports the data into S3. It’s offline, fast, secure (256-bit encryption), trackable, and much cheaper than uploading over the internet.

Scale Message Processing – Use SNS + SQS Fan-Out Pattern
When one app produces messages and many microservices need to consume them, the best design is to publish messages to an SNS topic and subscribe multiple SQS queues. Each service reads from its own queue, so they’re fully decoupled and can scale independently. This setup handles spikes (even 100k msgs/sec), guarantees delivery, supports retries and dead-letter queues, and lets you add new consumers easily. Flow: App → SNS Topic → multiple SQS queues → different microservices.
