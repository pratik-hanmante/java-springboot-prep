✅ 1. Amazon EFS – Shared File System for Multiple EC2 Instances

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed, serverless, and elastic file storage service that grows and shrinks automatically as files are added or removed. It can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances simultaneously using the NFSv4 protocol. EFS supports concurrent access, making it ideal for web applications, shared media storage, content management systems, microservices, and central log storage. Unlike EBS, which is attached to a single instance, EFS provides shared storage with high availability across multiple Availability Zones and delivers low-latency access. By migrating data from EBS volumes to Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and updating application storage paths, multiple EC2 instances can access the same documents at the same time without manual sync.

✅ 2. Secure S3 Access from EC2 Without Internet – Use VPC Gateway Endpoint

To securely access Amazon S3 from a private EC2 instance (without using the internet, NAT Gateway, or Internet Gateway), a Gateway VPC Endpoint should be used. This creates a private connection between the EC2 instance and S3 within AWS’s internal network. This approach improves security, reduces latency, and eliminates data transfer costs over the public internet. Proper IAM policies and bucket policies should be implemented to allow access only through the VPC Endpoint for controlled security.

✅ 3. Secure Static Website on S3 with SSL/TLS Using ACM

If a static website is hosted on Amazon S3 (such as a fundraising or portfolio website), it must comply with regulatory requirements to protect data in transit. To enable secure HTTPS access, AWS CloudFront should be used in front of the S3 bucket along with SSL/TLS certificates issued via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). S3 website endpoints do not natively support HTTPS, but CloudFront provides HTTPS, caching, DDoS protection via AWS Shield, and faster global content delivery.

✅ 4. Restrict AWS Services Access to Only Organization Accounts

When an organization uses AWS across multiple departments through AWS Organizations, it may want to restrict access to its S3 buckets or services so that only accounts within the same organization can access them. The most efficient and low-maintenance method is to add the global condition key aws:PrincipalOrgID in the S3 bucket policy or IAM policy with a reference to the Organization ID. This automatically allows only AWS accounts under the same organization without manually whitelisting each account.

✅ 5. Analyze JSON Logs in S3 Using Amazon Athena

If log files are stored in JSON format in an S3 bucket and the organization needs to perform simple, on-demand SQL queries for analysis without modifying the existing architecture, Amazon Athena is the best choice. Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows running SQL queries directly on data stored in S3. There is no need to load data into a database or set up infrastructure; users only pay per query. It integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog to define the schema and enables instant querying of raw log files.

✅ 6. Accelerate File Transfer to S3 – Use S3 Transfer Acceleration

S3 Transfer Acceleration speeds up data uploads and downloads over long distances by routing traffic through Amazon CloudFront Edge Locations. This utilizes AWS's global backbone network instead of the public internet, reducing latency and improving transfer speeds significantly. It is ideal for distributed teams or applications uploading data to an S3 bucket in a remote region.

✅ 7. AWS Tape Gateway – Cloud-Based Virtual Tape Library for Backup

AWS Tape Gateway, part of AWS Storage Gateway, provides a Virtual Tape Library (VTL) solution that allows organizations to back up on-premises data directly to Amazon S3 or Glacier using their existing backup software like Veeam, NetBackup, or Commvault. It eliminates the need for physical tape infrastructure, provides durable offsite backups with 11 9’s durability, encryption, automation, lifecycle policies, and significantly lowers costs compared to traditional tape-based archiving.
